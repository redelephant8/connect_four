      Welcome to Connect Four!

      Every turn, the current player will choose which column to place a tile in and
      the tile will fall and stack on other tiles in the same column.

      Player 1 is represented with ğŸ”´
      Player 2 is represented with ğŸŸ¡

      The first player to have 4 tiles in a row, horizontally, vertically, or
      diagonally wins!

      Who's ready for some Connect Four!?
