Welcome to Connect Four!

Every turn, the current player will choose which column to place a tile in and
the tile will fall and stack on other tiles in the same column.

Player 1 is represented with ðŸ”´
Player 2 is represented with ðŸŸ¡

The first player to have 4 tiles in a row, horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally wins!

Who's ready for some Connect Four!?
